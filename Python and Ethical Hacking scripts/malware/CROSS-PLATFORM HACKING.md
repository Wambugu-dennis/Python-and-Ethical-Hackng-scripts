CROSS-PLATFORM HACKING
    Converting Python Programs To OS X Executables
    
        reqs:  OSX comes with python and pip pre-installed
                - script to update the broken pip > https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py 
                - run the script > sudo python get-pip.py
                - installing pyinstaller > sudo pip isntall pyinstaller
        > for icon download, use step in trojans but select .ICNS type which is used in osx  
        
        Packaging:  
             
            > pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon pdf.icns backdoormalfile*.py
            > navigate to dist directory for the new malicious file
                note: in osx the file extension is not necessary
                
                
      Converting Python Programs to Linux Executables  
      
           requires social engineering since linux executable do't run by double clicking
           steps: assumin you are at the directoty of your malicious file
            > install pyinstaller: sudo pip install pyinstaller
            
                    packaging:
            > pyinstaller --onefile --onefile --noconsole backdoormalwarefile.py
            
                    running the malicious file on targets machine
            > navigate to file directory
            > change file permissions: chmod +x backdoormalwarefile.py
            > ./ backdoormalwarefile.py    (assuming you have the listener already running)
