PACKAGING  MALWARE FOR WINDOWS

making an executable ( .exe - use windows to prepare it) for windows
steps:
	> navigate to directory  where python is install
	
		commands:
			dir\python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller
			dir\pyinstaller.exe  (filename eg backdoor.py)  --onefile --noconsole
			        > (--noconsole is used whenever we have the .check_output
			
	> navigate to dist directory and locate the executable (backdoor.exe)
	
	> use the executable on any windows machine that doesnt have python installed
			> it's however detectable by AV softwares (to be explained later below) 	
			
			
PACKAGING  MALWARE FOR WINDOWS FROM LINUX

> install windows python interpreter on linux
> use it to convert python programs to windowws executables
steps:
    resources link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/
                    preferably use the MSI installer*
                    
     runing the .msi file               
    > navigate to dir of .msi file location
    
      commands to run windows programs inside linux:
          > wine msiexec /i python2.7.14.msi              
               a normal windows installer pops up > click next... until installed
               
          > the program is installed on hidden home dir 
                    > use ctrl + h to show hidden directories in home dir
                    > navigate to the .wine dir and open
                    > navigate to virtual dir named drive_C & open
                    > navigate to python27* dir containing python interpreter
           > from the linux terminal navigate to...
             > cd ..
             > cd .wine/drive_c/python27     
             > wine python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller
              
      >> converting python programs to windows executables 
            note: ensure all libraries used in your python program exists on the system you're using to package
       installing a library on linux(windows lib on linux)
       (using a program with two separate files as an example and pynput library imported)
       
       commands:
           > navigate to file location / directory
           > wine /home*/.wine/drive_c/python27/python.exe -m pip install  pynput
           
        packaging:
          note: packaging a program that uses multiple file, package the file that calls everything
            
          commands:
            > wine /home*/.wine/drive_c/python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe zlogger.py --onefile --noconsole  
            
            > navigate to the dist directory and locate the .exe executable file
