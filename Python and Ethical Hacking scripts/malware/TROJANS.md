TROJANS
    * this is a file that resembles and fuctions as a normal file eg pdf or image file
    * when run/executed, it opens the normal file as expected and also executes malicious code in the background
        Creating a Trojan By Embedding Files In Program Code
        steps:
        > wine /home*/.wine/drive_cpython27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --add-data "/home/Downloads/Sample_file.pdf;." --onefile --noconsole backdoor.py
        
        
        > run the lister and wait for incoming connection from target machine
        
     * Adding an Icon to generated executables
        > iconfinder.com
               . search icon by file type, set price to free and icon quality to eg:128px
               . set quality to highest possible
               . download png
        > use easyicon.net to convert .png to preferred .ico icon type   
        
        command to add icon:  
        > wine /home*/.wine/drive_cpython27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --add-data "/home/Downloads/Sample_file.pdf;." --onefile --noconsole --icon /home*/user*/path_to_.ico/pdf.ico backdoor.py  
        
      * Adding the correct extension to the malicious file eg: .pdf
            note: file extensions are normally hidden, but incase the target system has not;
            use:
                character interchanger program to switch pdf.exe to exe.pdf
                select common names ending in exe that may seem like a typo
                the computer reads and interchanges the extension
                    eg: readm-fdp.exe changes to readmexe.pdf
                    this is the same exeecutable file read by the target machine in reverse
                    this may be sufficient spoof to trick the target
             > zip the file and delver to your target via your identified attack surface 
             > the file runs when unzipped on the target as intended (trojan) withou relying on known vulnerabilities.
