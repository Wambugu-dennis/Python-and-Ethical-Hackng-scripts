PERSISTENCE PROGRAMS
    
    >> These programs start when the system starts
         eg: backdoors to maintain access on target, keyloggers for spying on a target & reporters to send a report on on startup.
    
    Persistence is implemented by adding a value to the registryof the target computer.
    normally, adding registry entries via cmd is done by:
    note: for help on commands use reg your_command* /?
     
           commands:
            >> reg add HKCU\Software\Microsft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v name_of_entry-eg:backdoor /t REG_SZ /d "C:\  backdoor.exe" /background 
                    note:- this program start every time the target system starts; even if the system is restarted
