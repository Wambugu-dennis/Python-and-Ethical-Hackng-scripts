BYPASSING ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAMS
     how AVs work:
        code - compare file against large dbs of signatures
               --evaded by using unique code, obfuscation, adding useless operations, encoding, pack etc
        behaviour - run file in a sandbox and analyze its behaviour
                    --evaded by running trusted operations before malicious code
                    --delaying execution of malicious code
                    
        >> test malicious files against avs using  -> nodistribute.com
        >> use UPX to compress .exe's to avoid/minimize detection by most AVs  (available on their github repo)
            UPX USAGE:
            1. move the uncompressed upx dir to /opt directory
            2. navigate to /opt/upx dir
            3. to compresse your .exe
                > ./upx /home*/username*/dir_to_your_.exe_file/dist/your_malwarefile.exe -0 (output_file) compressed_malwarefile.exe
